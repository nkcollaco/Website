Both R and Python are very useful languages and both have their pros and cons. What is great about python is that many if not all of the statistical techniques learned this semester in R can be replicated in python.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::knit_engines$set(python= reticulate::eng_python)
library(reticulate)
conda_list()
use_python("	C:\\Users\\nkcol\\AppData\\Local\\r-miniconda\\python.exe")

```

```{R}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(kableExtra)
library(GGally)
library(cluster)
library(readxl)
RankedMeasuredData <- read_excel("CopyOf2020 County Health Rankings Data - v1.xlsx", 
    sheet = "Ranked Measure Data")
AdditionalMeasureData <- read_excel("CopyOf2020 County Health Rankings Data - v1.xlsx", 
    sheet = "Additional Measure Data")
Education <- read_excel("CopyOfEducation.xls")
Education%>% filter(State=="TX")->TXEducation
RankedMeasuredData%>% filter(State=="Texas")-> RankedMeasuredData
AdditionalMeasureData%>% filter(State=="Texas")-> AdditionalMeasureData
TXEducation%>% rename(c("County"=`Area name`))->TXEducation
left_join(RankedMeasuredData,TXEducation, by="County")->partialdata
left_join(partialdata, AdditionalMeasureData, by="County")->fulldata

fulldata%>%select(County,`Life Expectancy`,`% Adults with Obesity`,`% Physically Inactive`,`% Smokers`,`% Food Insecure`,`% Uninsured`,`% Adults with Diabetes`,`Percent of adults with a bachelor's degree or higher, 2014-18` , `Median Household Income`, `% Insufficient Sleep`,`% Excessive Drinking`,`% Rural`)->project2
project2%>% na.omit()->project2
project2%>% rename(Lifeexpt=`Life Expectancy`)%>% rename(pctObese=`% Adults with Obesity`)%>% rename(pctInactive=`% Physically Inactive`)%>% rename(pctFDInsecure=`% Food Insecure`)%>% rename(pctSmokers=`% Smokers`)%>% rename(pctUninsured=`% Uninsured`)%>% rename(pctDiabetes=`% Adults with Diabetes`)%>% rename(pctBachelors=`Percent of adults with a bachelor's degree or higher, 2014-18`)%>% rename(medianincome=`Median Household Income`)%>% rename(pctinsufficientsleep=`% Insufficient Sleep`)%>% rename(pctRural=`% Rural`)%>% rename(pctexcessdrinking=`% Excessive Drinking`)->project2
project2%>% mutate(RuralorUrban=if_else(pctRural>50, "Mostly Rural", "Mostly Urban"))->project2

```
This is the data that was used in project 2. I performed a linear regression in both R and in python. 

```{r}
fit1<-lm(Lifeexpt~pctObese ,data=project2)
summary(fit1)
```
```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from statsmodels.formula.api import ols

project2= r.project2
fit= ols("Lifeexpt~pctObese", data=project2).fit()
fit.summary()

```
This code shows linear regression of Life expectancy to percent Obesity in Texas counties. The linear regression was performed in both R and in python showing just one of the many similar ways R and python can be used. They both showed a significant negative relationship between obesity and life expectancy. Showing that each percentage increase of obesity results in a decrease of -.131 years. 


Just for fun here's one of my favorite photos I've taken at UT!
